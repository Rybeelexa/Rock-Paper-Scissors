# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is my first JavaScript project on The Odin Project.I hope  it's going to be fun!
 STEP 1: Create a function getComputerChoice that will randomly return either 'Rock', 'Paper' or 'Scissors'.
So the function works when I use the OR operator, but the problem is that it only returns "Rock". There's no random outputs; which is what we want to achieve.
